    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Quinn Lanphere and I am a trainee Full Stack Developer with Futureproof from the US/UK. I have a curious personality and I am always looking to learn new things. I started learning to codew while studying engineering at University suing MATLAB. I realised I enjoyed the problem solving aspect and decided to try and learn Python as well using various web resources. I am excited and eager to jump into the world of Full Stack Development.</p>
